> Yes, badgers is an ingenious name. It contains the word badge, is similar to [badgen](https://badgen.net) (a popular badge generation service), includes the `-rs` suffix ðŸ¦€ and it's an actual word! Badgers are awesome animals. And they're also the mascot of the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Badgers). I don't know why I'm telling you this, I don't even live in the US. But hey, the more you know.

## Why SpaceBadgers?

The creation of SpaceBadgers was spurred by my experiences and challenges with existing badge generators such as shields.io and badgen.net. These platforms offer excellent services, but I found certain issues that could be improved upon. Here's why I decided to build SpaceBadgers:

**1. Performance:** Acknowledging past speed concerns with platforms like Shields.io, SpaceBadgers emphasizes high performance and reliability. Our Rust-based core library and Cloudflare worker enable swift, edge-based badge delivery. Smooth integration with third-party services is achieved via NextJS API routes on Vercel, and we continually aim to enhance speed by utilizing the `edge` runtime.

**2. Stability:** Badgen.net was created as a faster alternative to shields.io, but due to its lack of active maintenance, it often breaks, leading to broken images. SpaceBadgers is actively maintained and is committed to ensuring stability and uptime.

**3. SVG Exclusivity:** In contrast to Shields.io, which produces images, SpaceBadgers dedicates itself solely to the generation of SVGs. Recognizing the scalability and high-quality visuals of SVGs, we deemed them the ideal choice. To optimize performance, we serve SVGs in a minified form, ensuring a swift and efficient delivery of badges.

Building SpaceBadgers has been a labor of love, aiming to offer a superior, reliable, and open-source SVG badge generator for the developer community. I am excited to hear your feedback and to continue evolving this project with your help. Your suggestions, contributions, and active participation are always welcome.
